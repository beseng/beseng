- 👋 Hi, I’m Bibiana Seng!
- 💐 My professional interests include Statistics (I have a M.S. in it!), data analysis, project management, and collaboration. My best languages are R and Python, though I also know my way around SAS and MATLAB. 
- 💮 I enjoy the research process and have contributed to a few publications, like [this one](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/8/4/289) and [this one](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/9/1/16). Want a full list? Contact me!
- 🌻 I’m currently learning industry standard machine learning methods, best practices for management, and sharpening my coding skills.
- 🌼 My personal interests include project management (why yes, I do run my life with Kanban boards!), writing, homesteading, and playing far too many video games.
- 🌸 Always down to work on statistics problems! Message me [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bibiana-seng-125879128/).
